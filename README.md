# formula1_animated_barchart

This plot can be used as a general driver for plotting annimated bar charts, with **additional information inside each bar** (in our case the additional information is the points of each individual driver) 

**Data:** downloaded from *ergast* (https://ergast.com/mrd/)

**Disclaimer:** The code used for the project is highly inspired (i.e. indirect way of saying copied) from [this](https://github.com/amrrs/animated_bar_charts_in_R) github repo. The main idea is completely the same apart from the added information inside the bar charts and the preprocessing of the dataset.

This project was part of the Statistical Programming course - UoE - Master in Operational Research with Data Science 2019.
